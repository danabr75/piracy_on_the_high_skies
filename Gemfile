# Tutorial
# We recommend starting with the Ruby Tutorial on the wiki. For more documentation, check out the links in the sidebar.

# Other useful RubyGems
# There are several libraries that can give your games extra superpowers. Some of these libraries have not been updated in a while, so watch out for open issues on their GitHub pages.

# gem install releasy (Spooner/releasy)
# Automatically distribute any Ruby game as a Windows executable or Mac app.
# Built on top of the tools from the Deployment guides in the documentation wiki.

# gem install texplay (banister/texplay)
# Pixel-based drawing on Gosu images. (forum post)

# gem install ashton (Spooner/ashton)
# A C extension that integrates GL shaders and a particle engine with Gosu.

# gem install gamebox (shawn42/gamebox)

# gem install rmagick
# A powerful alternative to TexPlay, but very hard to distribute.
